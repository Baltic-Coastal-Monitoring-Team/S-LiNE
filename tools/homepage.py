    ### Introduction

    **S-LiNE** is an open-source toolbox for semi-automatic extraction and analysis of shoreline positions from LiDAR point cloud data, originally acquired by UAVs and airborne platforms. 
    Developed with coastal scientists in mind, it provides a flexible workflow for high-resolution mapping of dune coasts, enabling precise monitoring of coastal change and erosion dynamics.

    The main motivation behind S-LiNE is to deliver a fast, reproducible and modular solution for detecting coastal features based on topographic LiDAR data, 
    where the water-land boundary is not always clearly defined by intensity or elevation alone.

        This module adjusts raw LiDAR files in .las format from UAV (like the DJI Zenmuse L1 or L2) to a local geoid model to ensure consistency with national height systems (e.g. EPSG:2180).
        - Input: Geoid CSV + LAS files with elipsoid Z values 
        - Output: LAS files with corrected Z values (`_geoid.las`)
        - Modes: Single file or batch processing

        Extracts the shoreline directly from classified airborne LiDAR data.
        
        - Works with `.las` files containing ground and water classifications
